Enterprise Business Intelligence (BI) â€“ MSIS 670
This repository contains coursework, Tableau dashboards, and project deliverables from the MSIS 670 course at UMass Boston. The course focused on designing and implementing enterprise BI solutions, covering topics such as:

Enterprise data management

Advanced BI technologies (NLP, machine learning, AI)

Data-driven decision-making frameworks

Interactive data visualization using Tableau

Through hands-on labs and a semester-long project, I learned to transform raw business data into actionable insights, build intelligent dashboards, and apply BI best practices to solve real-world problems.
